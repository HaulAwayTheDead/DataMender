## ðŸš€ Implementation Priority

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Must have for MVP)
1. Core data processing engine
2. Basic CLI interface
3. Essential cleaning operations:
   - Remove duplicates
   - Handle missing values
   - Standardize date formats
   - Trim whitespace

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Nice to have)
1. Simple GUI interface
2. Data preview functionality
3. Configuration saving/loading
4. Progress indicators

### **LOW PRIORITY** (Future versions)
1. Advanced GUI features
2. Batch processing
3. Custom cleaning rules
4. Plugin system

## ðŸ“… Timeline (October 7, 2025)

**Current Time**: Starting development
**Target Completion**: Evening (8-10 PM)

### **Phase 2A**: Core Engine (2-3 hours)
- Data loading/saving modules
- Issue detection algorithms
- Basic cleaning operations

### **Phase 2B**: CLI Interface (1-2 hours)
- Command-line argument parsing
- CLI workflow implementation
- Basic error handling

### **Phase 3**: Basic GUI (2-3 hours)
- Simple Tkinter interface
- File selection and preview
- Cleaning configuration

### **Phase 5**: Packaging (1 hour)

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Stack

**Core Language**: Python 3.8+
**GUI Framework**: Tkinter (built-in)
**Data Processing**: pandas, csv, json (standard libraries)
**CLI Framework**: argparse (standard library)
**Packaging**: PyInstaller
**Testing**: unittest (standard library)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

### **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
- CLI tool with core cleaning features
- Simple GUI interface
- Windows executable
- Linux executable
- Basic documentation

### **Full Release Package**
- Cross-platform executables
- Complete user documentation
- Sample data files
- Installation guides
- Source code with tests

---

## ðŸš§ Known Challenges & Mitigation

1. **Time Constraint**: Limited to one evening
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on MVP features only
   
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Different OS requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Use Python standard libraries, test on target platforms
   
3. **GUI Complexity**: Tkinter limitations
   - **Mitigation**: Keep interface simple and functional
   
4. **Packaging Issues**: PyInstaller dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Test packaging early, have fallback plans
